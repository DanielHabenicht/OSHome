# Welcome to OSHome!

OSHome is a single executable that allows you to integrate any device running an OS into your smart home. 
It is designed to be lightweight and easy to use - similar to ESPHome.

- Execute a command on a device based on a trigger in home assistant. 
- Monitor the status of a device with a custom command. 
- Integrate all of your _one off python scripts^TM^_ without thinking about connectivity or setting up yet another service.

Future plans:
- Monitor connected bluetooth devices and maybe even proxy them to home assistant.

## Examples

Monitor a device with a custom command:
```yaml

```


## Roadmap
- [ ] Custom compilation for modular builds and custom extensions.
