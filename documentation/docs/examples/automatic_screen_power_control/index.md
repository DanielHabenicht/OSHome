# Automatic Screen Power Control

Control the screen power state based of a PIR sensor. The screen will turn on when motion is detected and off after a timeout.

```yaml
--8<-- "examples/automatic_screen_power_control/raspberry.yml"
```

1. If the commands are not working you can try out others from the [screen on/off example](../screen_on_off/index.md).
